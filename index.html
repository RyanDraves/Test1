				<p id="aboutText" class="secondText">	Hello! Welcome to the Science Squad! We are a nonprofit made for youth, by youth, that promotes scientific inquiry and the pursuit of STEM careers in Western Michigan. Our goal is to engage the youth of Western Michigan in activities that will better prepare our generation for the scientific and technological advances that loom before us. We host events such as science fairs and summer camps, as well as presentations on scientific breakthroughs and misconceptions. Every event that we host is completely free. To view some of our programs, check the tab above, or to fulfill daily dose of science, head over to our <a href="#">YouTube Channel</a>, where we host a live lecture series with professionals, or our <a href="3">Facebook</a>, where we often share entertaining science articles and videos.</p>
